# Filehashes
Validated/Trusted Plugins and Themes for Betterdiscord, used in [Lightcord Client](https://github.com/Lightcord/Lightcord) (comming soon)

# What it is ?
Every time you receive a plugin/theme on Discord (in an attachment), Lightcord will tell you if it's trusted or if it doesn't know.
Lightcord hashes the plugin content and compare if there's a similar plugin in this repository.
It shows a little icon like this: 
![Lightcord Trusted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lightcord/filehashes/master/images/60DL7OU.png)<br />
if a Lightcord Developer has made the plugin/theme, It shows a Discord-Partner like icon
![Lightcord Trusted Developer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lightcord/filehashes/master/images/gr5GJIc.png)<br />
And if the plugin/theme is suspected for being a threat, it will show up a do-not-disturb icon plus a warning when clicking on it.

# Why ?
Plugins in BetterDiscord can be dangerous. They can leak data, destroy your account or anything else you could do yourself.

Lightcord is here to give this little layer of security that you wouldn't have with any other Discord Client.
It has this list of trusted plugins/themes and warns the users that a plugin can be dangerous. 
This way, the user can still enjoy the experience of BetterDiscord and Plugins without having to fear anything.

# How do I get verified ?
We take some times to find random plugins that works and aren't verified, that way, we can expand the list.
If you aren't in it and you wish to, open an issue with the link to the source code of the plugin/theme (warning: Please give us the right source code. We won't be able to make the correct hash, and so to whitelist your plugin if it isn't the one who is distributed) and we'll see if the plugin is secure. If it is, you should be added to this list in less than two days.
